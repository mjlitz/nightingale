//aaron is writing more things
for documenting the importance of a word
by default all words get 0
the end of each word has [n] where n is its importance
example:
"The[0] word[2] importance[5] values[3] have[2] no[5] meaning[5] in[0] this[1] example[2]"
will that be enough info an word importance to generate music related to them?
matt pls reply

for demo purposes we should focus on only parsing well formatted lyrics, if someone removes all punctuation and newlines figuring it all out is just a pain. we're only going to help epople who give at least pretty good input

maybe we should add a tempo slider
the tempo slider needs a box next to it that you can just set the tempo manually and type 60 or 120 or something and it will adjust the slider automatically. why? because so tha blind people can use it. i know a blind dude who reads music in abc notation and i'm not sure if a blind person using a sceenreader can use sliders in webpages, but text boxes he can definitely use
