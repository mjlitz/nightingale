//aaron is writing more things
for documenting the importance of a word
by default all words get 0
the end of each word has [n] where n is its importance
example:
"The[0] word[2] importance[5] values[3] have[2] no[5] meaning[5] in[0] this[1] example[2]"
will that be enough info an word importance to generate music related to them?
